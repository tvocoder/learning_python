# python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can executed as soon as it is written.
# This means that prototyping can be very quick.

# Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-orientated way or a functional way.

# Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use
# simicolons or parentheses

# Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope.
# Scope of loops, functions, and classes.
# Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.
